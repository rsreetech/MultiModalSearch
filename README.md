# MultiModalSearch
In this repository i demonstrate how you can perform multimodal(image+text) search to find similar images+text given a test image+text . I use the Kaggle Shopee dataset. I use Tensorflow and hugging face sentence transformers to extract image and text embeddings to create a joint embedding search space
